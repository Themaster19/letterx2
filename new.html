<span> Princess, </span>
<br /> 
From the day we met I knew I'd love you for <br /> a lifetime. 
At the start of this all I honestly didn't think you would fall for me. It felt like fireworks going off the day you said yes to me. You should of seen how happy I was. Now we are 3 months in and I couldn't of asked for a better partner, I love you and no matter what I'll always be cheering you on and supporting you as well as being proud of you. I know we had rough moments but with you I know we can overcome anyhting. From our first call to you yelling at me for small things like sleep, I can't wait til you yell at me in person as I admire your beauty and wiseness <3. Smiling as you yell being the luckiest guy ever to pull a girl like you. I love you through every storm and every sunny day, nothing will ever bring us down as long as we have eachother.
